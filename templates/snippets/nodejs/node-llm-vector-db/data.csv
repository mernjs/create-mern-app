This process involves heating and melting the coconut oil, without the use of any chemicals. It is a purely natural process that results in a liquid form of oil at regular temperatures."
Is you Cutting Board Oil FDA approved?,"Yes, our CLARK'S Coconut Cutting Board Oil is made from food-grade coconut oil that is listed in the FDA inventory of Food Contact Substances, as stated in Title 21 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations. This means that the coconut oil used in our product meets the standards set by the FDA for materials that come into contact with food."
Is your Soapstone Slate & Concrete Wax suitable for all stone?,"Yes, our Soapstone Slate & Concrete Wax is suitable for use on all types of porous stone, including slate.

Will the scent of the Cutting Board Oil transfer to my food?,"We use all-natural essential oils used in our products, and they will not transfer to your food. While these essential oils are chosen for their pleasant scent and antimicrobial properties, they disperse fairly quickly after application. This means that they will not impart any taste or scent to the food prepared on the surface treated with our products. You can enjoy the benefits of the essential oils without any concern about them affecting the flavor or aroma of your food."
How often do I need to oil and wax my cutting board?,"The frequency of oiling and waxing your cutting board can vary based on several factors. These include how often you wash the board, the climate in which you live, the wood species of the board, and the orientation of the wood grain. Observing the appearance of the wood will give you an indication of when it needs to be refinished.

If you notice the wood losing its color and appearing dry, it's a sign that it's time to reapply oil and wax. The frequency can range from once every few weeks to once every few months, depending on the specific circumstances. It's not an exact science, so it's important to keep an eye on the wood and use your judgment.

Remember, you can never overapply the finish as long as you wipe off any excess when you're done. So if you're uncertain, it's always safe to reapply the oil and wax as needed."
How often should I reapply the Soapstone & Concrete Wax?,"The frequency of reapplying wax will depend on how often you use the surface and the specific needs of your surface. As you become familiar with the appearance of a freshly waxed surface, you can use it as a reference point. Ideally, the countertop should appear dark, rich, and hydrated immediately after waxing.

Over time, with regular use, you may notice the stone looking lighter and dried out. These visual indicators suggest that it's time to refinish the surface by applying wax again. As a general guideline, many people choose to reapply the wax once a month. However, this frequency can be adjusted based on your specific surface and its requirements. You may find that your countertop needs waxing more or less often depending on its condition.

By monitoring the appearance of the surface and using your judgment, you can determine the appropriate interval for reapplying the wax to keep your surface looking its best."

Would this be suitable for sealing a stone hearth,As long as the hearth does not get real hot when the fireplace is in use the wax should work well.
I purchased the 32oz wax and have weighed it on two different scales and it is under 26oz including the plastic jar. Why is this?,"Rich Harris:  The 32 oz wax is actually fluid ounces, so the container is filled by volume and not weight. "
Will the cutting oil and wax work on antique furniture?,The oil and wax combo should work fine on antique furniture.  It would be best to try it first in a small spot since we don't know what kind of wood or finish may have been used to create the piece.
"""Is it high heat resistant?""",Our wax will definitely start to melt with temperatures that push beyond 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
"Do we have information on how long the mineral oil (or all our oils) can be stored and it is still good to use? Also, is it best kept in a cool, dry place?","""Mineral oil has an extremely long shelf life and, if it is kept somewhere cool, dry and dark, it does even better. Our coconut oil (used in cast iron oil also) is fractionated and also known as MCT oil and it has a pretty long shelf life as well though not quite that of the mineral oil. Keeping our coconut oil in a cool, dry and dark place is especially ideal in helping to extend its shelf life. 

When kept in these conditions mineral oil can usually last for more than a couple of years while coconut oil should remain good for at least a year if not more. """
Are all the products vegan?,At Clark's all of our oils would be considered vegan but all wax is made using beeswax and that might not fly with some vegans.
Would it be safe to finish the smoker with your oil and wax?,While mineral oil can technically catch fire it has a very high flashpoint of over 300° F and doesn't necessarily burn easily. For this particular application I would say the customer would be fine using our oil since the flame would be within glass and not in direct contact with the wood.
Will your product give it a nice glossy finish without peeling,"Our products are excellent at caring and preserving wood while bringing out the natural beauty of the wood grain without any harsh chemicals.

Our use of all natural ingredients makes our products ideal for use in the kitchen where food may come in contact. It will also work very well on furniture items and when applied as seen in the link below, will protect and care for the wood a good long while. Our products do need to be reapplied over time depending on the use and placement of the furniture piece and are not a one-time application such as a glossy sealant like polyurethane. Our oils and waxes are meant to nourish the wood and help preserve it's natural look and feel.

Allow the oil a couple of hours to soak into the wood and wax a half hour or more to penetrate before buffing and wiping it down very well so as to not leave any residue.

"
Does it only have coconut oil?,"Yes, the product is made with 100% fractionated coconut oil. The ‘fractionated’ part is important, as it means it is different to your typical culinary coconut oil used in cooking. It is an odourless liquid, which is rich in hydrating properties and keeps your cutting boards well maintained!"
Coconut Cutting Board Oil - does it go through a chemical or steam process?,"The process used to fractionate coconut oil is simply a long heating and melting process, no chemicals of any kind are used. It is still an all-natural product that stays in a liquid form at regular temperatures. "
"Is there any difference between the oil used to season cast iron and the oil for the cutting board, can it be used interchangeably?","The different labels, one for coconut oil and another for cast iron oil, are designed to cater to the specific needs and preferences of our customers. Despite the labeling, the oils are interchangeable and offer the same quality and benefits for both seasoning cast iron and conditioning cutting boards."
Are your products gluten free?,". At this moment, our products have not undergone rigorous gluten testing. As a result, we are unable to provide you with a definite answer regarding the presence of gluten in our products.

We understand that dietary concerns are important, and we take them seriously. While we strive to create products that are safe for a wide range of dietary needs, we recommend exercising caution if gluten is a concern for you."
CLARK'S Soapstone Slate & Concrete Wax not sealed,"the cap on the large 32 oz wax only has a moisture liner, it does not come with a seal. "
what are the exact ingredients,"Our soap is a Castile soap base blended with lavender and rosemary oils.
 
The soap base is made up of the following ingredients: Organic Cocos Nucifera (Coconut) Oil, Organic Olea Europaea (Olive)Fruit Oil, Organic Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Potassium Hydroxide, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Citric Acid, Organic Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Flower Extract."
How many sq feet does each bottle of oil and wax cover?,"Our products work great on all types of wood but each type of wood receives the oil in its own way. Some take a lot and others not so much. The condition of the wood must be considered as well because wood that isn't treated regularly, if at all, will most likely be pretty dried out, requiring more oil at first especially. These factors play a major role in how much oil is needed and make it difficult to say exactly how far the 12 oz bottle of oil will go. 

Suffice to say that you should get many quality uses out of our oils and waxes when applied to the average wood surfaces and nothing too extreme. 
"
I am looking for a sealer that I could use for sealing candle vessels made from Jesmonite (the wax is poured directly into the vessels ). Do you think Clark's Stone & Concrete wax would be suitable for that purpose? Is it heat-resistant and non toxic even at high temperatures?,"Our wax is definitely nontoxic but will begin to melt as temperatures climb over 100° and completely liquid by 180°

Depending on the size of the vessel, our wax may do the job if it's not very close to the flame. If it does get pretty warm, it might not be the right option."
